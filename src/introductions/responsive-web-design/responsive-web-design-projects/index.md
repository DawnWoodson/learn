## Introduction to the Responsive Web Design Projects

<p>Now it's time to put together all of the skills you have learned so far to create five responsive web design projects.</p> 
<p>In each of these projects you can build your project by forking the CodePen pen. Or you can use the CDN link to run the tests in any environment you like.</p>
<p>In each project there are User Story requirements you must complete in order to pass, but the way it looks is yours to design.</p>
<h3>A Tribute Page</h3>
<p>Build a one-page site telling us about your favorite person. You'll do a little research for this one. You'll provide a timeline of his/her life and image.</p> 
<h3>A Survey Form</h3>
<p>Build a freeCodeCamp survey form that utilizes the skills you've learned. You'll create text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons and more. Creating this survey form will help you create other types of forms with ease, especially the famous short form that collects only your name and email.</p>
<h3>A Product Landing Page</h3>
<p>Landing pages are popular now, even if someone has a full website so completing this project will give you the confidence you need to move forward in this area. Build a product landing page that is responsive, uses Flexbox, media queries, and an embeded video.</p>
<h3>A Technical Documentation Page</h3>
<p>Helping others learn is your way of giving back. In this project you'll build a technical documentation page on the subject of your choice to help others learn more. Condense what you think are the most important things to learn about your subject.</p>
<h3>A Personal Portfolio Webpage</h3>
<p>You should feel proud of the work you've done so far and now it's time to let everyone else see your work. Build a personal portfolio webpage to show off all of your new skills by displaying your completed projects.</p>
